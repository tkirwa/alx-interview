# 0x03. Log Parsing

This project involves creating a Python script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.4.3
- PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)

## Description

The script reads stdin line by line and computes metrics based on the following input format:

`<IP Address> - [<date>] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" <status code> <file size>`

Lines that do not match this format are skipped.

After every 10 lines and/or a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C), the script prints the following statistics from the beginning:

- Total file size: `File size: <total size>`
    - `<total size>` is the sum of all previous `<file size>` values.
- Number of lines by status code:
    - Possible status codes: 200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405 and 500
    - If a status code doesn’t appear or is not an integer, it is not printed.
    - Format: `<status code>: <number>`
    - Status codes are printed in ascending order.

## Usage

Run the script as follows:

```bash
./0-generator.py | ./0-stats.py 
```

Please note that the output may vary due to the random values generated by `0-generator.py`.
